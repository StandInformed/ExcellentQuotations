| Mark Twain            | The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.                               |
| Plato                 | No one knows whether death, which people fear to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.                                 |

| Marry Pettibone Poole | To repeat what others have said requires education. To challenge it requires brains.                                                 |
| Alec Bourne           | It is possible to store the mind with a million facts and still be entirely uneducated.                                              |
| Bill Gates            | Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself.    |
| Albert Einstein       | Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.                                                                |

| George Bernard Shaw        | A happy family is but an earlier heaven.                                                                                             |
| Bill Cosby                 | You know the only people who are always sure about the proper way to raise children ? Those who’ve never had any.                    |
| Trey Parker and Matt Stone | Family isn’t about whose blood you have. It’s about who you care about.                                                              |
| Leo Tolstoy                | All happy families resemble one another. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.                                              |
| Pope John Paul II          | As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live.                                                 |
| George Bernard Shaw        | If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well make it dance.                                                         |
