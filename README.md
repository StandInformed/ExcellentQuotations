| Leo Tolstoy         | It is not beauty that endears; it’s love that makes us see beauty.                                                                   |

| E.E. Cummings         | It takes courage to grow up and turn out to be who you really are.                                                                   |

| Ernest Hemingway      | Courage is grace under pressure.                                                                                                     |
| John Wayne            | Courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway.                                                                             |
| Mark Twain            | It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world and moral courage so rare.                                      |

| Benjamin Franklin     | In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.                                                             |
| Buddha                | Even death is not to be feared by one who has lived wisely.                                                                          |
| Mark Twain            | The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.                                                                               |
| Will Rogers           | The only difference between death and taxes is that death doesn’t get worse every time Congress meets.                               |

| Mark Twain            | The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.                               |
| Plato                 | No one knows whether death, which people fear to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.                                 |

| Socrates              | The only true wisdom is knowing that you know nothing.                                                                               |
| Marry Pettibone Poole | To repeat what others have said requires education. To challenge it requires brains.                                                 |
| Alec Bourne           | It is possible to store the mind with a million facts and still be entirely uneducated.                                              |
| Bill Gates            | Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself.    |
| Albert Einstein       | Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.                                                                |
| Wu Ting-Fang          | Education is like a double-edged sword. It may be turned to dangerous uses if it is not properly handled.                            |
